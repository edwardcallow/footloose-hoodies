					<h4>Long bio</h4>
					<p>Backwell School Productions are proud to present ‘Footloose’ as the 2017 Sixth Form Production. This foot-tapping adaptation of the Broadway musical is directed, produced and performed entirely by the talented students of Backwell School Sixth Form. This family-friendly production follows the story of Ren McCormack, a troubled teenager from the City of Chicago, as he struggles to adjust to the small-town life of Bomont.
					<br/><br/>
					Following the tragic death of a group of teenagers and under the influence of the town’s preacher, dancing has been banned in Bomont. With the help of his new-found friends – the Reverend’s rebellious daughter Ariel and Willard, a country hick – Ren hopes to help heal the town from the tragedy that affected them all. The music is on his side as Ren fights Reverend Moore and the town council, to let the teenagers of the town dance once again.
					<br/><br/>
					All proceeds will go to the Great Western Air Ambulance, who provide life-saving emergency care to people in remote locations and in critical states around our community. You cannot afford to miss this fantastic production, supporting a fantastic cause.</p>
